/*I'll help you complete the assignment on SQL Window Functions from pages 26-31 of your lecture document. The assignment requires working with window functions like LAG(), LEAD(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), and aggregate functions on a dataset of your choice.

# SQL Window Functions Assignment Solution

Let's create a comprehensive solution that addresses all the requirements. First, I'll create a sample dataset, and then I'll write all the required queries with clear explanations.

## Dataset Creation

Let's create a sales dataset for an electronics retail company with regional data:

```sql
-- Create the sales table
CREATE TABLE electronics_sales_1 (
    sale_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR2(100),
    category VARCHAR2(50),
    region VARCHAR2(50),
    sale_date DATE,
    quantity NUMBER,
    unit_price NUMBER,
    total_amount NUMBER
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (1, 'iPhone 14 Pro', 'Smartphones', 'North', TO_DATE('2023-01-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 10, 999, 9990);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (2, 'Samsung Galaxy S23', 'Smartphones', 'South', TO_DATE('2023-01-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 8, 899, 7192);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (3, 'MacBook Pro', 'Laptops', 'East', TO_DATE('2023-01-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 5, 1499, 7495);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (4, 'Dell XPS 13', 'Laptops', 'West', TO_DATE('2023-01-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 4, 1299, 5196);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (5, 'iPad Air', 'Tablets', 'North', TO_DATE('2023-01-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 12, 599, 7188);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (6, 'Samsung Tab S8', 'Tablets', 'South', TO_DATE('2023-02-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 7, 649, 4543);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (7, 'Sony PlayStation 5', 'Gaming', 'East', TO_DATE('2023-02-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 6, 499, 2994);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (8, 'Xbox Series X', 'Gaming', 'West', TO_DATE('2023-02-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 5, 499, 2495);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (9, 'AirPods Pro', 'Audio', 'North', TO_DATE('2023-02-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 20, 249, 4980);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (10, 'Bose QC45', 'Audio', 'South', TO_DATE('2023-02-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 9, 329, 2961);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (11, 'iPhone 13', 'Smartphones', 'East', TO_DATE('2023-03-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 12, 799, 9588);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (12, 'Google Pixel 7', 'Smartphones', 'West', TO_DATE('2023-03-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 6, 599, 3594);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (13, 'HP Spectre', 'Laptops', 'North', TO_DATE('2023-03-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 3, 1399, 4197);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (14, 'Lenovo ThinkPad', 'Laptops', 'South', TO_DATE('2023-03-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 5, 1199, 5995);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (15, 'Samsung Galaxy S22', 'Smartphones', 'East', TO_DATE('2023-03-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 7, 749, 5243);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (16, 'Asus ROG Phone', 'Smartphones', 'West', TO_DATE('2023-04-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 4, 899, 3596);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (17, 'Microsoft Surface', 'Laptops', 'North', TO_DATE('2023-04-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 6, 1299, 7794);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (18, 'MacBook Air', 'Laptops', 'South', TO_DATE('2023-04-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 8, 1199, 9592);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (19, 'Samsung Galaxy Tab A', 'Tablets', 'East', TO_DATE('2023-04-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 10, 349, 3490);
INSERT INTO electronics_sales_1 VALUES (20, 'Amazon Fire', 'Tablets', 'West', TO_DATE('2023-04-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 15, 149, 2235);
```

Now, let's address each query requirement:

## 1. Compare Values with Previous or Next Records

For this task, I'll compare the total sales amount with previous and next records using LAG() and LEAD() functions:

```sql
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    region,
    sale_date,
    total_amount,
    LAG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS previous_amount,
    LEAD(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS next_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_amount > LAG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN total_amount < LAG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'LOWER'
        WHEN total_amount = LAG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'EQUAL'
        ELSE 'FIRST RECORD'
    END AS comparison_with_previous,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_amount > LEAD(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN total_amount < LEAD(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'LOWER'
        WHEN total_amount = LEAD(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) THEN 'EQUAL'
        ELSE 'LAST RECORD'
    END AS comparison_with_next
FROM 
    electronics_sales_1
ORDER BY 
    sale_date;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query uses LAG() and LEAD() to access the previous and next record's total_amount values.
- For each record, we compare the current total_amount with the previous and next values.
- The CASE statements determine if the current amount is HIGHER, LOWER, or EQUAL compared to previous/next records.
- If there's no previous record (first row), it shows 'FIRST RECORD'. If there's no next record (last row), it shows 'LAST RECORD'.
- The data is ordered by sale_date to maintain chronological comparison.

## 2. Ranking Data within a Category

For this task, I'll rank products within each category by their total sales amount using both RANK() and DENSE_RANK():

```sql
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    total_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total_amount DESC) AS rank_in_category,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total_amount DESC) AS dense_rank_in_category
FROM 
    electronics_sales_1
ORDER BY 
    category, 
    total_amount DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query partitions the data by category and orders each partition by total_amount in descending order.
- RANK() assigns a unique rank to each row within the partition, with gaps in the ranking sequence when there are ties.
- DENSE_RANK() assigns a unique rank to each row within the partition, without gaps in the ranking sequence when there are ties.
- For example, if two products have the same total_amount, RANK() might assign ranks 1, 1, 3, 4, while DENSE_RANK() would assign 1, 1, 2, 3.
- This makes DENSE_RANK() more suitable when you want consecutive rankings without gaps.

## 3. Identifying Top Records

For this task, I'll fetch the top 3 products with highest sales in each category:

```sql
WITH ranked_products AS (
    SELECT 
        sale_id,
        product_name,
        category,
        region,
        total_amount,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total_amount DESC) AS product_rank
    FROM 
        electronics_sales_1
)
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    region,
    total_amount,
    product_rank
FROM 
    ranked_products
WHERE 
    product_rank <= 3
ORDER BY 
    category, 
    product_rank;
```

**Explanation:**
- I use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first rank the products within each category by total_amount in descending order.
- DENSE_RANK() is used to handle potential ties properly (if two products have the same total_amount, they get the same rank).
- The outer query filters to keep only records with rank <= 3, which gives us the top 3 products in each category.
- This approach handles duplicate sales amounts appropriately by giving them the same rank but still counting them towards our top 3.

## 4. Finding the Earliest Records

For this task, I'll retrieve the first 2 sales transactions from each region based on sale_date:

```sql
WITH ranked_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        sale_id,
        product_name,
        category,
        region,
        sale_date,
        total_amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date) AS sale_sequence
    FROM 
        electronics_sales_1
)
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    region,
    sale_date,
    total_amount,
    sale_sequence
FROM 
    ranked_sales
WHERE 
    sale_sequence <= 2
ORDER BY 
    region, 
    sale_date;
```

**Explanation:**
- I use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a sequence number to each sale within each region, ordered by sale_date.
- Unlike RANK() or DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() guarantees unique values (no ties) which is perfect for selecting exactly 2 records.
- The outer query filters to keep only records with sale_sequence <= 2, giving us exactly the first 2 sales from each region.
- This is useful for identifying initial trends or early customer behaviors by region.

## 5. Aggregation with Window Functions

For this task, I'll calculate both category-specific maximums and the overall maximum total amount:

```sql
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    product_name,
    category,
    region,
    total_amount,
    MAX(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY category) AS category_max_amount,
    MAX(total_amount) OVER () AS overall_max_amount,
    ROUND((total_amount / MAX(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY category)) * 100, 2) AS percent_of_category_max,
    ROUND((total_amount / MAX(total_amount) OVER ()) * 100, 2) AS percent_of_overall_max
FROM 
    electronics_sales_1
ORDER BY 
    category, 
    total_amount DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query shows each individual sale alongside aggregated values for context.
- MAX(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY category) calculates the maximum total_amount within each category.
- MAX(total_amount) OVER () calculates the maximum total_amount across the entire dataset.
- The percentage calculations show how each sale compares to its category maximum and the overall maximum.
- This type of analysis helps identify top performers both within categories and globally.
- Using PARTITION BY differentiates between category-level calculations and overall calculations.

## Real-Life Applications of Window Functions

Window functions have numerous practical applications in business analytics:

1. **Sales Performance Analysis**:
   - Compare sales against previous periods to identify trends
   - Rank sales representatives within regions to recognize top performers
   - Calculate running totals to monitor progress toward quotas

2. **Financial Analysis**:
   - Track stock price movements compared to previous trading days
   - Calculate moving averages for smoothing out short-term fluctuations
   - Rank investments by returns within portfolio categories

3. **Customer Behavior Analysis**:
   - Identify top spending customers by segment
   - Calculate customer retention rates over consecutive time periods
   - Analyze purchase frequency patterns with time comparisons

4. **Supply Chain Management**:
   - Track inventory levels against previous periods
   - Rank suppliers by delivery performance within product categories
   - Identify earliest and latest deliveries to optimize logistics

5. **Human Resources**:
   - Compare employee performance metrics to department averages
   - Rank employees by metric while accounting for department differences
   - Track salary progression over time relative to company averages

These window functions enable sophisticated analytics without complex self-joins or subqueries, making the code more readable and maintainable while improving performance.
